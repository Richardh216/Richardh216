Hi there, I'm Richard! ðŸ‘‹
I'm a 21-year-old Computer Science student with a passion for building robust and efficient software. I've recently embarked on my studies at Technical University of Munich (TUM), eager to dive deeper into the world of technology.

Having completed the challenging core curriculum at 42 Heilbronn, I've cultivated a strong foundation in low-level programming and hands-on problem-solving. I'm a firm believer in continuous learning and always driven to expand my skillset and tackle new challenges.
